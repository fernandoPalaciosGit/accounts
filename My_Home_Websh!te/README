This is a php project for a home website/blog/disaster

It would be a lot easier to actually use a framework for 
building a website, but this project is about studying/learning
php/css and possibly some javascript.

The end result (for whats its worth) can be seen at the below
link (although the site is down more often than a prossies 
knickers):
