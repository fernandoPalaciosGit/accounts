Having graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from NUI Maynooth in 2007, 
I started my career with SQS as a software tester. After stints with AIB, Pocketkings and several
other short term contracts, I am now entering the cloud with Dell. My interests include Photography, 
Drinking and trying to attain the title of geek. I've been married to Ling since Feb 2010, although this 
has yet to be ratified by the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
